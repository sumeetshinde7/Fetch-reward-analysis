<u> Email to the Product lead at Fetch regarding data check: </u>

Hi James,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to discuss an important aspect of our data-related work that impacts the accuracy and reliability of our product.
Recently, I assessed our data quality and identified some potential issues that require attention. I'd like to provide you with an overview of the findings and discuss the steps we can take to address them effectively.
Here are the observations and related questions/suggestions:
1.	I observed that there is significant absence of information about a product being a metaBrite product (almost 90%). In the market, what fraction of the products are considered to be metaBrite? 

2.	50% of the brands we are hosting do not have an indication of them being a topbrand. As a company we should be capturing this information to see which are the topmost brands and reduce the points a customer gains through the large volume of sales of products of these brands.

3.	Around 10% of our userbase does not reveal their location and we are unable to capture their login information. Is some of our userbase international which makes it difficult to get user information? Is there a possibility of users from remote locations using VPNs to connect to Fetch and use it out of USA?

4.	We are encountering unknown brand names associated with receipts which are alien to our existing brands data. Are new brands being added to the pool? If yes, we would certainly need to update the databases to these new upcoming brands.

5.	Going forward our product platform might encounter scalability issues. Receipts and Item information need to be accessed frequently. As a part of data team we would need to have data partitioning and indexing to ensure faster processing on our platform. Adding more servers and scaling horizontally is the solution to manage large volumes of data. 

I believe that addressing these data quality issues and planning for performance considerations will significantly enhance the reliability and efficiency of our systems, ultimately supporting better decision-making and business outcomes.
Please let me know if you have any questions or if there are specific areas you'd like to discuss further. I'm here to provide any additional information and support required.

Best regards,

Sumeet
